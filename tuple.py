The tuple is similar to lists since the value 
of the items stored in the list can be changed, 
whereas the tuple is immutable,
and the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed.
A tuple can be written as the collection of comma-separated (,) 
values enclosed with the small () brackets.'''
