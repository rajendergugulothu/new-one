'''A list in Python is used to store 
the sequence of various types of data. 
Python lists are mutable type its mean 
we can modify its element after it created.

that are capable to store the sequences,
A list can be defined as a collection of values or items
of different types.
The items in the list are separated with the comma (,) 
and enclosed with the square brackets [].'''
